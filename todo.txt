OOF2 TODO

This file is for high-priority or long-range TODOs for which a comment
in the code is insufficient for some reason.

Add an OutputDestination that saves objects to a given Python array.

Upgrade to gtk+3 and use libcairo instead of libgnomecanvas.

Allow the Remove Material button in the Element Group operations pane
on the Skeleton Selection page to remove the material from an element
to which a material has been only implicitly assigned.  Currently,
attempting to do that raises a KeyError.

Floating periodic boundary conditions.  For example, a system with
thermal expansion and periodic boundary conditions should be able to
expand as a whole.

Input into the console window should be saved in logs.  User defined
constants and functions that are use in boundary conditions or
initializers need to be saved. Also, non-command lines can be read
from input scripts, and they should be saved too.  When reading from a
script, should logging be done by the script reader, and not by the
menu command?  Menu commands are only logged when executed by the gui?
